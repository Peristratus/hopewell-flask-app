 ## Description

 This milestone project is part of my on going Full Stack Software Developer course at Canadian Business college in collaboration with the Code Instititute.
 The website is based on a fictional Medistar Hospital Flask app, the app's theme is based on a hospital and their services to the general public.The user(s) will be able to 
 navigate through the site, register as a patient, Doctor, nurse or admin, the information will be submitted into Mongodb database. The user wull also be able to interact
 with an Artificial Intelligent chat bot that speaks to the user(s), at this momment the AI is able to have a meaningful conversation and respond to a 
 Covid-19 emergency, dispatch paramedics to the patients residents or location, this is simulated and not a real live software, the AI has been coded 
 to look for key words and phrases which trigger a response to the user, AI is also able to book appointments and inform the users Doctor of any pertinent information,
 this is also simulated, but I hope to grow to the level where i will be able to code the AI to have these additional attributes. Once a user is registered and logs into their portal, they are paired 
 with their doctor through the Mongodb, this enables user and Doctor to send short messages between themselves to either book appoinments , remind patient to monitor blood pressure,
 Glucose level or check up with patient after surgery and etc. The Doctor is able to make request for prsecription, request for medical test(s) and procedure(s), all the information is submitted to Mongodb.
 The doctors also have two AI tools at their disposal for disgnosis of Diabetes and Heart Disease, these tools are built on datasets from Kaggle and IEEE data port. The datasets are
 based on machine learning for 400 - 1000 different individulas cases from various age groups, sex with a positive of nagative result. The AI for Diabetes is built on a threshold 1=Positive / 0= Negative.
 The AI for Heart Disease Threshold >40 positive with 70 percent accuracy < 40 negative with 70 percent accuracy.
 
 Disclaimer: The AI for diabetes , Heart Disease and AI chat bot are not built to be used for realworld applications but only developed for educational purposes, further testing and improvements are need
 to further develop these tools.

## User-Acceptance-Testing

The UAT will define the criteria by which the website is considered to be "working",high, medium or low defects will be identified and cataloged for further improvements or regression testing.
The UAT critreria and results will confirm if the website can handle required task in a real-world scenarios, according to the Requirements Traceability Catalog Table 1.0.

## Technologies 

The technologies employed to develop this web application was based on the principles of Design for X (DFX) also know as Design for excellence, the basis of this methodology is based
on cost to quality, making effective use of resources to minimize cost and relay more on innovation and technical knowledge to meet the users expectations.The software's used are mostly free 
and meet the **Requirements Traceability Catalog Table 1.0** to develop this website, innovation and technical knowledge was based on my recently aquired skills based on my journey so 
far with Code institute and the Canadian Business College.

 ## Deployment 

 After my User Acceptance Testing (UAT) I pushed the final version of my code to git hub , in my commit message I cataloged each change before my final push, the steps I took 
 can be seen below. 

 1. Complete the User UAT evaluation and made sure that all codes are funtional and operational.
 2. Used git commit -m to catalog all my changes in line with UAT requirement.
 3. Used git push to push my final version to my git hub repository. 
 

 Before my final push on github I had already deployed my project on Herouku to check connectivity and I clicked on the automatic deploy from master to ensure that all changes on github are reflected on heroku.
 Steps for deployment can be seen below, my project is now live on Heroku [Medstar Hospital](https://hopewell-hospiria-project.herokuapp.com/)
 
 1. Create the env.py
 2  Created the gitignore file to ignor the _pycache_ and env.py
 3. Installed libaries and loged them in requitements.txt
 4. Create the PROCFILE
 5. Login to Heroku 
 6. Click on create new app
